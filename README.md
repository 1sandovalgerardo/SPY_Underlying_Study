# SPY_Underlying_Study
Code to assist with the analysis of US equities
The primary files are: 
1. ExecutiveSummary_Corr
  a. This file will contain the order in which to run the functions to get the results 
  that where posted on my website.
  b. This is also the order the functions where intended to be used.
2. CorrHelpers
  a. Contains the funtions that are accessed in the Executive Summary py file.
  b. They are also found in the my_helpers jupyter notebook.
  
I use jupyter notebook to build out ideas and test them as I develop them.
Once I am satisfied with how a funciton works, i copy it to a .py file.

Notes on the working_file:
These will allow you to see how I worked through a few ideas until I found something actionable.
I started to break up my work into multiple notebooks as the original one was becoming too large.
Here is the progression, starting with the earliest:
1.working_file.ipynb
2.working_file_corr.ipynb
3.working_file_corrB.ipynb
4.working_file_corrResults.ipynb
